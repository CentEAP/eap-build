Building JBoss EAP 6, or something similar...

As I'm not able to build JBoss EAP 6, I've made a script who can download JBoss EAP 6's source code, download it's Maven repository, patch the repository and launch the build.

The result won't be a JBoss EAP 6 binary but something with a few differences.

If you want to run the script :

  git clone git://github.com/hasalex/eap-build.git
  cd eap-build
  ./build.sh

By default, it builds EAP 6.1.0. You can build other versions by passing the number to the build :

  ./build.sh 6.0.1

It doesn't work ? Check if you have installed wget, unzip and java (JDK).

For the moment, it supports 6.0.1 and 6.1.0.
