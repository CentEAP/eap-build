Building JBoss EAP 6, or something similar...

As I'm not able to build JBoss EAP 6, I've made a script who can download JBoss EAP 6's source code, download it's Maven repository, patch the repository and launch the build.

The result won't be a JBoss EAP 6 binary but something with a few differences.

If you want to run the script :

  git clone git://github.com/hasalex/eap-build.git
  cd eap-build
  ./build.sh

The script has been tested under Ubuntu 12.04. It downloads the source code of JBoss EAP 6.0.1 .
